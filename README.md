# symex-vp

A virtual prototype based on [riscv-vp][riscv-vp github] with [symbolic execution][wikipedia symex] support.

## Installation

This software has the following dependencies:

* A C++ compiler toolchain with C++17 support
* [CMake][cmake website]
* A recent version of [Z3][z3 repo] (`4.8.X` is known to work)
* [LLVM][llvm website] version `10`
* [Boost][boost website]

After all dependencies have been installed run:

	$ make

Executable binaries are then available in `./vp/build/bin`.

## Dockerfile

To ease installation a `Dockerfile` is provided. To build a docker
image from this provided `Dockerfile` use the following command:

	$ docker build -t riscv-symex .

Afterwards, run the docker image using:

	$ docker run --rm -it riscv-symex

Executable binaries are available in `/home/riscv-vp/riscv-vp/vp/build/bin`.

## Usage

Consider the following assembly example program:

	.globl _start
	_start:

	/* Make word (4 bytes) at addr 0x0 symbolic */
	li a7, 96 /* SYS_sym_mem */
	li a0, 0  /* address 0x0 */
	li a1, 4  /* 4 bytes */
	ecall     /* execute make_symbolic ecall */

	/* Load symbolic memory word into register a1 */
	lw   a1, 0(t0)

	li a2, 23
	blt  a2, a1, true
	addi a3, a3, 1
	true:
	addi a3, a3, 2

	li a7, 93 /* SYS_exit */
	ecall     /* Signal end of execution */

This example program contains a single branch instruction (`BLT`). The
program can be compiled using:

	$ riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o main main.S -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -nostartfiles

Afterwards, execute it using:

	$ symex-vp --intercept-syscalls main

The `symex-vp` will discover two paths through this program. One where
`BLT` jumps to `true` and one where it doesn't. The value of the `a3`
register will differ in these two executions.

## Provided VPs

The following virtual prototypes are available:

* `symex-vp`: A very minimal virtual prototype, based on `tiny32-vp`
  from the original riscv-vp repository. This allows testing very basic
  bare-metal RV32 software.
* `hifive-vp`: A virtual prototype mostly compatible with the
  [SiFive HiFive1][sifive hifive1]. This allows executing software
  for embedded operating systems like [RIOT][riot website] or
  [zephyr][zephyr website] symbolically.
* `test32-vp`: This virtual prototype is intended to be used with
  the [riscv-compliance][riscv-compliance github] repository. This is
  primarily useful for development (e.g. during testing of new
  RISC-V extensions).

## Design

This software allows symbolic execution of software compiled for RV32.
Registers or memory values can be marked symbolic explicitly using an
intercepted `ECALL` instruction. Branches based on symbolic values are
tracked and as soon as execution terminates a new assignment for
symbolic variables is determined which discovers new paths for the
program by negating encountered branches. For each new assignment, a new
SystemC simulation is restarted from the beginning. After all
encountered branches have been negated, the virtual prototype
terminates.

Errors are signaled by the executed software through a custom `ECALL`.
This `ECALL` can, for instance, be used in `panic` handlers et cetera.
For each path causing an invocation of this `ECALL` a test file with
concrete input values is created. This test file can be replayed by
pointing the `SYMEX_TESTCASE` environment variable to the corresponding
test case file. It is also possible to terminate execution upon
encountering the first error using the `SYMEX_ERREXIT` environment
variable.
